Overall Objective: To provide a crystal-clear, unambiguous explanation of every rule and parameter governing a trader's challenge. By the end, the user will understand the "why" behind each rule and know exactly what they need to do to stay within the guidelines and succeed.

Lesson 2.1: The Aurum Philosophy on Rules
Objective: To frame the rules not as restrictions, but as a professional framework for success.
Format: A concise, text-based introduction to the module.
Key Talking Points:
"Welcome to Module 2. In professional trading, rules are not limitations; they are the bedrock of consistency and long-term success. Every hedge fund and proprietary trading desk operates on a strict set of guidelines."
"The rules at Aurum are designed with one purpose: to eliminate the common causes of failure and force the habits of profitable traders. They are your guardrails on the path to funding."
"In this module, we will cover every rule in detail. Our goal is 100% transparency. By the end, you will have a master's understanding of the evaluation criteria."
Call to Action: A button that says "Let's Begin: Profit Targets →"
Lesson 2.2: Your Objective: Understanding Profit Targets
Objective: To clearly define the profit targets for both phases of the challenge.
Format: Text with a simple table or graphic for clarity.
Key Talking Points:
"Every challenge has a clear objective: to reach a specific profit target. This demonstrates that your trading strategy has a positive expectancy."
The Targets:
Step 1 (Challenge): Your target is to achieve a 10% profit on your initial account balance. (e.g., +$500 on a $5k account).
Step 2 (Verification): Your target is to achieve a 5% profit on your initial account balance. (e.g., +$250 on a $5k account).
Tracking Your Progress: "You can monitor your real-time progress towards your target on your 'Account History' dashboard. The progress bar gives you an at-a-glance view of how close you are to your goal."

Lesson 2.3: The Hard Deck: Max Overall Loss Explained
Objective: To explain the single most important rule that a trader must not breach.
Format: Text with a clear, bolded warning and a simple example calculation.
Key Talking Points:
"This is the most critical rule of your evaluation. The Max Overall Loss is your 'hard deck'—the point at which your account is breached. It is set to 10% of your initial account balance."
How it Works: "This is a static drawdown based on your starting balance. It does not trail your profits. This gives you a fixed amount of risk capital to work with throughout the entire challenge."
Example: "On a

1,000. This means your account equity must never, at any point, drop below $9,000. If it does, the challenge is considered failed."
Monitoring: "Your 'Account History' dashboard shows your current risk metrics, allowing you to see exactly how much drawdown you have available."
Call to Action: A button that says "Next: How We Eliminate Daily Losses →"
Lesson 2.4: The Agentic Advantage: No Daily Loss Limit
Objective: To explain this unique and powerful feature, reinforcing the value of the platform.
Format: Text-based, focusing on the benefit to the trader.
Key Talking Points:
"Many prop firms have a 'Max Daily Loss' rule that can cause traders to be disqualified by a single, volatile price swing. We've eliminated that."
Why? "Our agentic trading system is designed to manage risk at the trade level. By enforcing a strict Risk-to-Reward on every single trade, the possibility of you hitting a traditional 4-5% daily loss in a single day is virtually impossible."
Your Freedom: "This frees you from the psychological pressure of watching a daily loss limit. Your only focus needs to be on your overall drawdown and your strategy, not an arbitrary daily number."
Call to Action: A button that says "Next: Trading Session Rules →"
Lesson 2.5: One Session, One Trade: A Masterclass in Patience
Objective: To deep-dive into the "One Trade" rule and its practical application.
Format: Text-based with a clear breakdown of the sessions.
Key Talking Points:
"As we covered in Module 1, our 'One Session, One Trade' rule is the core of our discipline framework. Let's look at the specifics."
The Three Sessions: Define the approximate times for the Asia, London, and New York sessions (e.g., in EST or UTC).
How it Resets: "Once a session ends and the next one begins, your ability to place a trade is unlocked again. This means you have a maximum of three potential, high-quality trading opportunities per day."
The Strategy: "This rule forces you to skip low-probability setups. If the market isn't giving you a clear signal during a session, the correct professional decision is to do nothing and wait for the next session. Patience is a funded trader's greatest asset."
Call to Action: A button that says "Next: Risk-to-Reward Tiers →"
Lesson 2.6: Standard vs. Pro: Understanding Your Risk-to-Reward
Objective: To explain the two different challenge tiers and how the R:R is automatically applied.
Format: A clear comparison, perhaps using a two-column layout.
Key Talking Points:
"Aurum offers two distinct plans for each account size, allowing you to choose the risk profile that best suits your strategy."
Standard Plan:
Risk-to-Reward: 1:3
How it Works: "When you place a trade, our system automatically sets your take-profit at a distance three times your stop-loss. This is ideal for most trend-following and mean-reversion strategies."
Pro Plan:
Risk-to-Reward: 1:6
How it Works: "The Pro plan sets a more ambitious 1:6 R:R. This is designed for traders who specialize in high-conviction setups, targeting major market turning points or breakout continuations."
No Manual Adjustments: "Crucially, you cannot change these parameters. The system is your risk manager, ensuring you never deviate from a profitable risk management plan."
Call to Action: A button that says "Next: Permitted Instruments →"
Lesson 2.7: Your Trading Universe: Permitted Instruments
Objective: To clearly state which instruments are available for trading.
Format: Simple text and a bulleted list.
Key Talking Points:
"To encourage mastery and focus, we have curated a specific list of instruments for all challenges."
Currently Tradable Assets:
Gold (XAU/USD)
Silver (XAG/USD)
Oil (WTI/USOIL)
Major FX Pairs (as seen in the 'Take a Trade' section)
Why This List? "These instruments offer high liquidity, clear technical patterns, and are favored by professional traders. By focusing on this universe, you can develop a deep expertise rather than being distracted by dozens of markets."
Call to Action: A button that says "Next: Important Guidelines →"
Lesson 2.8: Prohibited Strategies & Account Conduct
Objective: To cover the "fine print" to ensure fairness and prevent any misunderstandings.
Format: A clear, serious, text-based lesson with bullet points.
Key Talking Points:
"To maintain a fair and level playing field for all traders, a few trading strategies are not permitted. Use of these strategies will result in the immediate failure of your challenge."
Prohibited Activities:
Copy Trading: "You cannot use any third-party copy trading services to mirror trades from another account."
High-Frequency/Arbitrage Bots: "The use of automated systems designed for latency arbitrage or high-frequency trading is strictly forbidden."
Account Sharing: "Your Aurum account is for your personal use only. Sharing access or having someone else trade for you is not allowed."
Our Guiding Principle: "The spirit of the Aurum challenge is to identify and fund skilled, individual traders who make their own decisions. As long as your trading aligns with this principle, you will be fine."
Call to Action: A button that says "Module Complete! Go to Module 3: Platform Features."


Module 3: Platform Features (6 Lessons)
Overall Objective: To build unshakable confidence in the Aurum system by revealing the sophisticated, data-driven logic behind its core features. This module will connect the founder's personal journey to the platform's design, justify its unique rules, and make a powerful case for why this is the user's best path to professional, funded trading.

Lesson 3.1: Why We Built This: A Founder's Journey
Objective: To create an immediate emotional connection by grounding the platform's features in the founder's personal story of struggle and discovery.
Format: A compelling, personal narrative from you.
Key Talking Points:
The Pain: "Before Aurum, there were years of wasted time and blown accounts. I was a trader with a decent strategy but no rules. I was my own worst enemy, falling into every psychological trap: fear, greed, revenge trading. I knew I needed a professional framework, but I couldn't find one that felt like a true partner."
The Epiphany: "The turning point came when I realized that consistent profitability isn't about finding a magic indicator; it's about having an unbreakable risk management framework. It's about making trading a science, not a gamble."
The Solution: "Every feature you're about to learn about—from our risk engine to our journaling agent—was born from that painful journey. We built Aurum to be the system I wish I had. It's not just a platform; it's a meticulously designed solution to the real problems traders face."
Call to Action: A button that says "Let's Explore the Core Feature: The Risk Engine →"
Lesson 3.2: The Brains of the Operation: The Aurum Risk Engine
Objective: To introduce the core logic of the ATR-based risk model, positioning it as an intelligent and superior system.
Format: Text with clear, simple explanations of technical concepts.
Key Talking Points:
The Problem with Fixed Pips: "Why do so many traders fail? Because they use arbitrary risk, like 'I'll risk 20 pips on every trade.' But 20 pips on a volatile pair like Gold is completely different from 20 pips on a stable pair. It's a recipe for inconsistency."
Our Solution: Volatility-Based Risk: "Our risk engine is different. It's built on the Average True Range (ATR), a professional tool that measures an asset's true volatility. This means your risk is always perfectly adapted to the current market conditions."
The 'Secret Sauce' Revealed: "Our core formula is: Risk Movement = 23% of the 4-Hour ATR. We derived this from backtesting Gold's proven risk parameters. By applying this data-driven rule across all instruments, we ensure every trade has a realistic, achievable target based on how that asset actually moves."
Why the 4-Hour Timeframe? "We chose the 4-hour ATR because it provides the perfect balance. The 15-minute is too noisy, and the daily is too large. The 4-hour allows us to capture meaningful trends while setting targets that are achievable within a normal trading session."
Call to Action: A button that says "Next: See How This Works in Practice →"
Lesson 3.3: Risk in Practice: Your Exact Targets
Objective: To provide absolute, crystal-clear clarity on the exact dollar amounts for risk and reward for every single account type and plan, leaving no room for ambiguity.
Format: Text followed by a clean, easy-to-read table.
Key Talking Points:
Your Constant: 0.25% Risk: "No matter the account size or instrument, your risk per trade is always fixed at 0.25% of your account balance. This is a non-negotiable rule of professional capital preservation and the foundation of our entire system."
From Percentage to Dollars: "Our engine takes this 0.25% rule and automatically calculates the precise dollar risk and target for every trade. The table below breaks down the exact numbers for your account. There is no guesswork. There are no manual calculations. This is your trading plan, enforced by the system."
Account Size	Your Risk Per Trade (0.25%)	Standard Target (1:3 R:R)	Pro Target (1:6 R:R)
$5,000	$12.50	$37.50	$75.00
$10,000	$25.00	$75.00	$150.00
$25,000	$62.50	$187.50	$375.00

*   **How to Use This Table:** "Find your account size and plan in the table above. These are the numbers the system will use for every single trade you take. Your only job is to focus on finding the right direction. The system does the rest."

Lesson 3.4: Spirit Journal: Your AGI Performance Coach

"The Risk Engine is your guardrail; it protects your capital. Spirit Journal is your catalyst; it accelerates your growth. It is designed to be the most advanced performance coach in the entire prop firm industry."
Spirit, Today: Your Analytical Partner
A Perfect Memory: "Every trade you take, including your entry reason, is automatically logged. Spirit has access to your full trading history, allowing it to connect your decisions to your results."
Visual Journaling: "Spirit doesn't just store text; it can store snapshots of your charts at the moment of entry, providing the complete visual context for your past trades. You'll never forget why you took a trade again."
Integrated Research: "Use its built-in TradingView charts to conduct your analysis without ever leaving our platform, ensuring a seamless workflow from research to execution."
The Vision: Spirit, Tomorrow (The AGI Coach)
"We are obsessively committed to building the best trading coach on the planet. Spirit is not a static feature; it's an evolving intelligence that will receive constant updates. Here is a glimpse of the future we are building for you:"
Deep Insight Generation: "Soon, Spirit will proactively analyze your entire trading history to give you raw, data-driven insights. It will answer questions like: 'Am I more profitable during the London or New York session?' or 'What is my win rate on Gold vs. Oil?'"
Your 'Always-On' Partner: "In the near future, Spirit will connect with you offline, sending you SMS alerts about market-moving events or providing a summary of your trading performance for the week. It will be your constant companion, helping you stay connected to your goals."
The Endgame: A True AGI Experience: "Our ultimate vision is for Spirit to become a true AGI coach—understanding your unique psychological patterns, identifying your specific weaknesses, and providing tailored feedback to help you break through your performance plateaus."

Objective: To build immense trust and aspiration by revealing your commitment to moving traders to live accounts.
Format: A confident, forward-looking statement.
Key Talking Points:
The Industry Problem: "A common frustration in the prop firm space is the feeling that you're stuck on a simulated account forever. This can limit your profit potential and feels less professional."
The Aurum Commitment: "Let us be clear: our goal is to be a globally respected funding partner. The challenge accounts are our vetting ground. Our endgame is to move our consistently profitable traders to a live trading environment, funded with Aurum's real capital."
Why This Matters to You: "Trading on a real account offers higher profit potential, true market execution, and the professional legitimacy you deserve. We are invested in finding and backing real talent for the real market."

Lesson 3.6: Are You the Trader We're Looking For?
Objective: To use the "filter" and then deliver a powerful, persuasive nudge to get them to start their first challenge.
Format: A direct, challenging, and ultimately empowering closing argument for the module.
Key Talking Points:
The Honest Question: "After learning about our data-driven framework, you should ask yourself: Is this for me? If you're looking for a place to gamble or a 'get rich quick' scheme, it is not. If you don't see the profound value in a system that enforces discipline, then you may not be the trader we're looking for."
The Pivot to Empowerment: "But... if you are tired of inconsistency and emotional mistakes... if you're ready to stop being your own worst enemy and finally trade within a professional structure... if you believe that discipline is the true path to funding... then you are exactly who we built this for."
The Final Nudge: "Every feature we've discussed is waiting to help you. The framework is here. The only missing piece is you. It's time to prove your discipline."

Module 4: Success Stories (Initial 5-Lesson Structure)
Overall Objective: To provide tangible proof that the Aurum framework creates successful traders. This module will dissect the real-world problems our first funded traders faced and show exactly how the platform's features provided the solution, inspiring new users to believe they can achieve the same.

Lesson 4.1: The Blueprint for Success: Why These Stories Matter
Objective: To introduce the module and frame these stories not as boasts, but as educational blueprints for the user's own success.
Format: A concise, text-based introduction.
Key Talking Points:
"Welcome to the most important module in this course. So far, you've learned about the platform's features and rules. Now, you'll see the results."
"A success story isn't just a testimonial; it's a blueprint. It's proof that the framework works when it's followed. The traders you're about to meet are not superhuman; they are disciplined individuals who decided to trust the system."
"Pay close attention to the specific problem each trader faced. You will likely recognize your own struggles in their stories. More importantly, you will see the specific solution that led to their breakthrough. Let's begin."
Call to Action: A button that says "Let's Meet Our First Trader: Justina →"
Lesson 4.2: Case Study: Justina U. on Mastering Risk Management
Objective: To use Justina's story to showcase how Aurum solves the number one killer of trading accounts: improper risk and position sizing.
Format: A case study format with a prominent quote, a problem/solution breakdown, and a key takeaway.
Key Talking Points:
The Trader's Voice (Quote):
"Most traders have an inability to calculate SL and TP points. What to risk in their accounts... risk management is the main issue. Aurum Prop Firm solves that... It has helped me to minimize my losses and maximize my winning trades." - Justina U., Funded Trader
The Problem: The Mental Overload of Risk
"Justina highlights a universal struggle: the constant, stressful calculation of risk. How much should I risk? Where does my stop-loss go? Is my target realistic? This mental energy spent on 'the math' is energy taken away from what truly matters: your analysis."
The Aurum Solution: Automated Discipline
"The Aurum Risk Engine (as you learned in Module 3) takes this entire burden off your shoulders. The fixed 0.25% risk, the ATR-based stop loss, and the automatic 1:3 or 1:6 targets mean the 'math' is already done. It's done perfectly, every single time."
The Transformation: From Calculator to Strategist
"By outsourcing her risk management to the system, Justina was able to allot more time to what she does best: working on her strategy and finding high-quality entries. The result? Minimized losses and maximized wins."
The Key Takeaway:
Focus your energy on finding the right direction. Let the system be your risk manager.

Lesson 4.3: Case Study: Osarenren I. on Protecting Profits
Objective: To use your own story to tackle the second biggest killer of trading accounts: over-trading and giving back profits.
Format: The same case study format.
Key Talking Points:
The Trader's Voice (Quote):
"I can take my first trade and make a profit of $500 and then take more trades that just takes me back to $0 or even a bigger loss... All I needed to do was just stay away from the chart. Aurum forces this on me and it's been phenomenal." - Osarenren I., Founder & Funded Trader
The Problem: The Emotional Rollercoaster
"Osarenren's story is one every trader knows intimately. The euphoria of a big win, followed by the impulsive need to trade more, which often leads to giving all the profits back. This isn't a strategy problem; it's an emotional control problem."
The Aurum Solution: The Enforced 'Walk Away'
"The 'One Session, One Trade' rule is the antidote to this self-sabotage. It's not a suggestion; it's a hard rule enforced by the platform. Once your trade for the session is placed, your job is done. The system forces you to protect your profits from your own worst impulses."
The Transformation: Keeping What You Earn
"By removing the ability to over-trade, the platform allows the initial, well-analyzed trade to stand on its own. The result is simple but profound: you actually keep the profits you make."
The Key Takeaway:
A profitable day is built on one good decision, not many. The platform is designed to protect that decision.
Call to action: A button that says "Next: The Common Thread →"
Lesson 4.4: The Common Thread: Outsourcing Your Discipline
Objective: To synthesize the two stories and reinforce the core value proposition of Aurum.
Format: A concise summary lesson.
Key Talking Points:
"What do these two very different problems—risk calculation and emotional control—have in common?"
"The solution for both was to outsource discipline to the system."
"Justina outsourced the complex math of risk management. Osarenren outsourced the emotional battle of when to stop trading. Neither had to rely on willpower alone, which is a resource that fails under pressure."
"This is the core philosophy of Aurum. We are your system for automated discipline. We handle the parts of trading where humans are weakest, so you can focus on where you are strongest: your analysis."
