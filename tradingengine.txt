Here's how i think the trading works. I'm sure oanda tracks if the trade placed has hit sl or tp so, 
i'm sure we're keeping track from there. The live trade should be a page that the client can refresh
when he/her needs to so that it doesn't just always refresh, or maybe auto refresh is better. 
THe live trades section should show the following. 
1. The following four prices. a. price of entry, b. price of tp, c. price of sl, d. current. 
2. It should show if the tp or the sl has hit at any point. If the tp has hit, the there should be a success badge on the
trade and if the sl was hit then a failed badge on the trade. If the trade is still running then it should show that.
3. IT should show the account that the trade was placed on, if it was a standard or a pro acount and the challange account, $5k
or $10k or $25k. 
4. It should show the time the trade was taken, okay.
