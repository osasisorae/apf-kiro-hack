GET	/v3/accounts/{accountID}/pricing/stream
Get a stream of Account Prices starting from when the request is made. This pricing stream does not include every single price created for the Account, but instead will provide at most 4 prices per second (every 250 milliseconds) for each instrument being requested. If more than one price is created for an instrument during the 250 millisecond window, only the price in effect at the end of the window is sent. This means that during periods of rapid price movement, subscribers to this stream will not be sent every price. Pricing windows for different connections to the price stream are not all aligned in the same way (i.e. they are not all aligned to the top of the second). This means that during periods of rapid price movement, different subscribers may observe different prices depending on their alignment.
Note: This endpoint is served by the streaming URLs.
GET	/v3/accounts/{accountID}/instruments/{instrument}/candles
Fetch candlestick data for an instrument.

Order Definitions


Orders
The specification of all Orders supported by the platform.

Order	The base Order definition specifies the properties that are common to all Orders.
MarketOrder	A MarketOrder is an order that is filled immediately upon creation using the current market price.
FixedPriceOrder	A FixedPriceOrder is an order that is filled immediately upon creation using a fixed price.
LimitOrder	A LimitOrder is an order that is created with a price threshold, and will only be filled by a price that is equal to or better than the threshold.
StopOrder	A StopOrder is an order that is created with a price threshold, and will only be filled by a price that is equal to or worse than the threshold.
MarketIfTouchedOrder	A MarketIfTouchedOrder is an order that is created with a price threshold, and will only be filled by a market price that touches or crosses the threshold.
TakeProfitOrder	A TakeProfitOrder is an order that is linked to an open Trade and created with a price threshold. The Order will be filled (closing the Trade) by the first price that is equal to or better than the threshold. A TakeProfitOrder cannot be used to open a new Position.
StopLossOrder	A StopLossOrder is an order that is linked to an open Trade and created with a price threshold. The Order will be filled (closing the Trade) by the first price that is equal to or worse than the threshold. A StopLossOrder cannot be used to open a new Position.
GuaranteedStopLossOrder	A GuaranteedStopLossOrder is an order that is linked to an open Trade and created with a price threshold which is guaranteed against slippage that may occur as the market crosses the price set for that order. The Order will be filled (closing the Trade) by the first price that is equal to or worse than the threshold. The price level specified for the GuaranteedStopLossOrder must be at least the configured minimum distance (in price units) away from the entry price for the traded instrument. A GuaranteedStopLossOrder cannot be used to open a new Position.
TrailingStopLossOrder	A TrailingStopLossOrder is an order that is linked to an open Trade and created with a price distance. The price distance is used to calculate a trailing stop value for the order that is in the losing direction from the market price at the time of the order’s creation. The trailing stop value will follow the market price as it moves in the winning direction, and the order will be filled (closing the Trade) by the first price that is equal to or worse than the trailing stop value. A TrailingStopLossOrder cannot be used to open a new Position.
Order Requests
The request specification of all Orders supported by the platform. These objects are used by the API client to create Orders on the platform.

OrderRequest	The base Order specification used when requesting that an Order be created. Each specific Order-type extends this definition.
MarketOrderRequest	A MarketOrderRequest specifies the parameters that may be set when creating a Market Order.
LimitOrderRequest	A LimitOrderRequest specifies the parameters that may be set when creating a Limit Order.
StopOrderRequest	A StopOrderRequest specifies the parameters that may be set when creating a Stop Order.
MarketIfTouchedOrderRequest	A MarketIfTouchedOrderRequest specifies the parameters that may be set when creating a Market-if-Touched Order.
TakeProfitOrderRequest	A TakeProfitOrderRequest specifies the parameters that may be set when creating a Take Profit Order.
StopLossOrderRequest	A StopLossOrderRequest specifies the parameters that may be set when creating a Stop Loss Order. Only one of the price and distance fields may be specified.
GuaranteedStopLossOrderRequest	A GuaranteedStopLossOrderRequest specifies the parameters that may be set when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. Only one of the price and distance fields may be specified.
TrailingStopLossOrderRequest	A TrailingStopLossOrderRequest specifies the parameters that may be set when creating a Trailing Stop Loss Order.
Order-related Definitions
OrderID	The Order’s identifier, unique within the Order’s Account.
OrderType	The type of the Order.
CancellableOrderType	The type of the Order.
OrderState	The current state of the Order.
OrderStateFilter	The state to filter the requested Orders by.
OrderIdentifier	An OrderIdentifier is used to refer to an Order, and contains both the OrderID and the ClientOrderID.
OrderSpecifier	The specification of an Order as referred to by clients
TimeInForce	The time-in-force of an Order. TimeInForce describes how long an Order should remain pending before being automatically cancelled by the execution system.
OrderPositionFill	Specification of how Positions in the Account are modified when the Order is filled.
OrderTriggerCondition	Specification of which price component should be used when determining if an Order should be triggered and filled. This allows Orders to be triggered based on the bid, ask, mid, default (ask for buy, bid for sell) or inverse (ask for sell, bid for buy) price depending on the desired behaviour. Orders are always filled using their default price component. This feature is only provided through the REST API. Clients who choose to specify a non-default trigger condition will not see it reflected in any of OANDA’s proprietary or partner trading platforms, their transaction history or their account statements. OANDA platforms always assume that an Order’s trigger condition is set to the default value when indicating the distance from an Order’s trigger price, and will always provide the default trigger condition when creating or modifying an Order. A special restriction applies when creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order. In this case the TriggerCondition value must either be “DEFAULT”, or the “natural” trigger side “DEFAULT” results in. So for a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order for a long trade valid values are “DEFAULT” and “BID”, and for short trades “DEFAULT” and “ASK” are valid.
DynamicOrderState	The dynamic state of an Order. This is only relevant to TrailingStopLoss Orders, as no other Order type has dynamic state.
UnitsAvailableDetails	Representation of many units of an Instrument are available to be traded for both long and short Orders.
UnitsAvailable	Representation of how many units of an Instrument are available to be traded by an Order depending on its positionFill option.
GuaranteedStopLossOrderEntryData	Details required by clients creating a Guaranteed Stop Loss Order
